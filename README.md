Ratings that allow differently abled people to rate specific venues in the cities. This will allow others to hear first hand about an experience, post questions, and read comments, all of which are accompanied by an average score from user ratings.

There is a lot of information on accessible travel, but specific venues, while they might display a wheelchair access symbol don’t offer details on what that means. Are there two ramps? Other obstacles in the vicinity of the building - things that change seasonally or aren’t covered by merely listing a wheelchair icon on one’s venue information.

These resources exist, but they are often busy and distracting, some connect to yelp ratings instead of making the accessibility the focus.

Functionality: Rating system (to be defined with criteria from ADA documentation, focus on physical mobility). Average score juxtaposed onto location of festival listing in search results with map. Comments left by users. Login with existing social media: Facebook & Google.

Questions/concerns on Functionality: APIs needed? Google maps, ADA wheelchair accessibility data on cities, any specific venue scoring that may exist (have not found). How to render score and appropriate comments to the correct venue?

Questions/concerns:

a. Addressing sensitivity in determining criteria for ratings. b. Addressing sensitivity in not patronizing differently abled people.

Stretch goals: Expand to needs for Deaf, HH, sensory sensitivity criteria. Events calendar and the ratings for events and how accessible they are. Market research, surveys to better the criteria for ratings and determine what specific information would be helpful.

Week 1:
a. Research
b. Finalize concept
c. Outline and wireframe
d. Basic set up: components, nav bar, templates for each page: login, registration, create, resources

Week 2: Deciding what technologies to use.
a. Fetch Google Maps API 19 Oct: map is rendering!
TODO: Need to render in app.js to display under Navbar. How to do?
b. Search function
c. Review form and Ratings system
d. Database to store reviews (or hardcode data for the purpose of this project)
e. Social media login

Week 3: Ditto Week 2.

Week 4: Finish styling and code freeze.
